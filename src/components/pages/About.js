        I am an full stack web developer that has just started my journey of coding. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp in December of 2020. There, I learned:
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>React</li>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>JQuery</li>
        <li>HandleBars</li>
        <li>Bootstrap</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>

        <br />
        <br />

        I graduated from Virginia Military Institute and began a career in the U.S. Army. I became an Armor Officer and served in Fort Benning with a Cavalry unit. After serving my time for my country, I decided to serve my community and moved back to Austin. Here, I started working for a non-profit organization in the medical industry and continued there through the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, I feel my calling is in tech and so I decided to learn coding. Full stack web development is just the first step in my journey to being in the tech world.

        When I am not coding or taking care of my cats, you can find me in the gym, moving that weight. I also like to read, socialize with my friends, and chow down on a delicious spaghetti.
