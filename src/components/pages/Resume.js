        I graduated from Virginia Military Institute and began a career in the U.S. Army. I became an Armor Officer and served in Fort Benning with a Cavalry unit. After serving my time for my country, I decided to serve my community and moved back to Austin. Here, I started working for a non-profit organization in the medical industry and continued there through the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

        Now, I feel my calling is in tech and so I decided to learn coding. Full stack web development is just the first step in my journey to being in the tech world.

        When I am not coding or taking care of my cats, you can find me in the gym, moving that weight. I also like to read, socialize with my friends, and chow down on a delicious spaghetti.
