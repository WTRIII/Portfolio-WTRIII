        In addition to being an entry level web developer, I am also an accomplished project manager. I managed a variety of projects in the Army as well as in the medical industry and am familiar with most corporate concepts.

        Something else that sets me apart from other devs is my ability to talk clearly to anyone. In my past, I needed to talk to and work with people from all walks of life - from Generals to high school graduates, from locals to foreigners. As such, I am comfortable interacting with most people and can publically speak quite well.
